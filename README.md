# Aakash
The Aakash flight computer served a very basic but crucial role of detecting launch, recovering the rocket safely at apogee, detecting its landing, and throughout this progression recording data.
This repository will give you a full hand overview on the algorithms we have used in the flight computer as well as the groundstation UI. Do feel free to suggest changes for futher improvement in our flight computer. Thank you !
